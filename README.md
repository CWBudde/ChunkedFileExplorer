# Chunked File Explorer
A tool to inspect chunked files such as PNGs, WAVs, AIFFs, MP4s and maybe TTFs in the future

## History
In the past I have done several projects that dealt with file juggling. Since many different file types shares a common mechanism, I decided to write a tool that allows to handle all of them in one tool. In the past I often copied and modified code from a certain pool for this task, but never managed to merge everything in one tool.

## Present
At the moment the tool does handle PNGs, WAVs and AIFFs quite well and with some certain depth. However, the most information can be seen inside the debugger, as they haven't been made available to the viewer so far. I'll try to constantly improve this tool rather to have several differnt half-baked private repositories.

## Future
Based on my other work, it shouldn't be much of a problem to also add some sort of TTF exploration. A similar half-baked tool is already present in the PascalType repository. However, as this is not needed at the moment, it might just be a brave wish.
